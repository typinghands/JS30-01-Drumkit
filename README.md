# JS30-01-Drumkit

The first project of the WesBos JS30 challenge, a simple web drumkit that can be used with the computer's keyboard.
I have mostly redesigned the site and tried to rebuild it as much as I could from scratch, the purpose of the site was mostly as a personal exercise for me in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

How to use it: 
The page will allow you to play out a set of 9 instruments all playable simply by typing the corrisponding key on your keyboard!
