# JS30-01-Drumkit

The first project of the WesBos JS30 challenge, a simple web drumkit that can be used with the computer's keyboard.
I have mostly redesigned the site and tried to rebuild it as much as I could from scratch, the purpose of the site was mostly as a personal exercise for me in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
